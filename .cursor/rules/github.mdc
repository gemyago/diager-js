Run release workflow using one of the commands below, depending on what user asks. User should mention version, if no suggest and confirm (see package.json for current version).
```sh
# Pre-release
gh workflow run release.yml --field release_name=<version> --field prerelease=true

# Pre-release from a specific branch 
gh workflow run release.yml --ref=<branch> --field release_name=<version> --field prerelease=true

# Normal release
gh workflow run release.yml --field release_name=<version> --field prerelease=false

# Watch for completion if asked
gh run watch <runId>

# Or periodically check status
gh run view <runId>
```
