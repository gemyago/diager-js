# TDD approach with automated approval

* Make sure to review [typescript.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/typescript.mdc) rules if it's a typescript
* You are approved to run tests or scripts when needed, don't ask
* Don't ask for plan approval, you are approved
* Don't ask for modifications confirmations, you are approved
* Write tests first
* If logic is complex, split on chunks and do this whole flow for each chunk
* When writting tests, prefer adding new test cases for new logic
* Run tests before implementing logic, analyse results and make adjustments of tests if needed
* Interate on implementation only after tests have added and executed (previous point), do not ask for approval to proceed
* Run tests after implementation is ready, analyse results
* follow [jest.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/jest.mdc) if you need to write or run unit tests
